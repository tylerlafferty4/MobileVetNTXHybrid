  <h2 style="color: white;">Mobile veterinary convenience to your door with plenty of expierience!!</h2>
  <p style="color: white;">
    Dr. Sherri Swanton practiced in Sanger and the North Texas area for nearly 8 years developing her skills in surgery, medicine, canine rehabilitation, reproduction, sports medicine, and health testing.
    One thing that she recognized while in practice was a need for a door to door service that had everything the small animal client needs.
    She is looking forward to serving most of Denton, Collin, Wise, Tarrant and Cooke counties and their surrounding areas.
    She will also be offering services at dog shows, OFA health testing, health certificates, door to door services for kennels and dog show clients!

    How it works: You call the clinic number <a href="tel:19409900862">(940) 990-0862</a> and schedule a time for the clinic to come to your door.
    You can schedule your own private appointment, or you can group it together with your neighbors and friends.
    Each trip under 50 miles from Sanger is $50, if you are over 50 miles away you will add $100 to your invoice (and there is a minimum fee for trips over 50 miles).
    If you combine the trip the fee it is split evenly amongst the participants.
