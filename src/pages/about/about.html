    Dr. Sherri Swanton was born and raised on a farm in Eastern Iowa. 
    She had a strong background in 4-H, showed dogs, cattle, and sheep, she rode horses and was very active in the arts, speech, plays and musicals. 
    She shares a love for showing dogs with her husband and they have several beautiful Australian Cattle Dog, and American Eskimo fur kids that they love and enjoy. 
    Dr. Swanton tries her hand at herding with her Australian Cattle Dogs, shows in multiple AKC events, and also has a little time for her Quarter horse Mare Danka and her beautiful medium haired kitty Pucci. 
    She enjoys both Surgery and Medicine and works hard to excel in both areas of interest. 
    She was one of the first veterinarians in North Texas to offer Stem Cell therapy and she has a special interest in Orthopedic injuries and rehab with Cold therapy lasers.

    Dr. Sherri Swanton practiced in Sanger and the North Texas area for nearly 8 years developing her skills in surgery, medicine, canine rehabilitation, reproduction, sports medicine, and health testing.
    One thing that she recognized while in practice was a need for a door to door service that had everything the small animal client needs.
    She is looking forward to serving most of Denton, Collin, Wise, Tarrant and Cooke counties and their surrounding areas.
    She will also be offering services at dog shows, OFA health testing, health certificates, door to door services for kennels and dog show clients!

    How it works: You call the clinic number <a href="tel:19409900862">(940) 990-0862</a> and schedule a time for the clinic to come to your door.
    You can schedule your own private appointment, or you can group it together with your neighbors and friends.
    Each trip under 50 miles from Sanger is $50, if you are over 50 miles away you will add $100 to your invoice (and there is a minimum fee for trips over 50 miles).
    If you combine the trip the fee it is split evenly amongst the participants.
